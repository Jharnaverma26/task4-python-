task 4: Loops & Iterations

This task is part of the Python Developer Internship.

In this task, I have demonstrated the use of loops and iterations in Python.

Topics covered:
- for loop (printing numbers from 1 to 100)
- while loop (countdown timer)
- break and continue statements
- iterating over string characters
- generating a multiplication table
- using range() with step size
- combining loops with conditions
- a simple real-world example using a list

Tools Used:
- Python
- VS Code

Outcome:
This task helped me understand iteration, looping concepts, and basic automation in Python.****
